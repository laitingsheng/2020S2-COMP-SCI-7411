\section{Preliminary Notes}

I've included a batch script to be run on my own Windows machine without altering system environment variables. For Debian-based distributions Linux, they should contain gradle, openjdk-8 and android-sdk packages in their official apt repository. However, I am not quite sure if this would also apply to other distributions as I personally prefer Ubuntu over other distributions. As long as Cordova can run correctly, it should be fine to build and emulate this app. The backend needs Node.js 10+.
