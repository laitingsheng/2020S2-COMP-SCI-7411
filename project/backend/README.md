# Backend Server

`npm install` will install all required dependencies, then `npm run build` will build the bundled file to `build/main.js`, which is also included (intentionally) in the submitted archive and the repository. `npm run start` can start the server easily. Hopefully, `babel` can recognise language features in ES2020 and transpile the code, but I am using Node.js 14 to complete this project.
